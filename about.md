My name is <strong>Karthikraj Duraisamy</strong>, and I am an Android application developer and designer. I work in both iOS and Android apps.

I am more like an product engineer with main focus on user experience. I do play around the tech stack, I do write code for server stacks, mobile apps. I like experiments and exploring new things.

Motivation is a key for consistency. Here are some quotes that I likes and helps me motivated.

> First do it, then do it right, then do it better is what i follows while taking up new roles.

> Nothing is innovated in the world as we had found everything available and innovations adds the special piece on it.

> While learning new things it is important to have a deep study, but much important is to get out *there* and *do*.
