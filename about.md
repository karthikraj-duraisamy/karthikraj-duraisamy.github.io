I successfully exited my employment career and I am currently building [OYKU](https://oykuapp.com) and calling myself as an entrepreneur nowðŸ˜‰. I love learning more and helping others understand what I learned.

In the past: 

I started my career as an Android developer and quickly added iOS development, Windows phone app development, ionic cross platforms app development, react native, flutter development, react apps, serverless backend development into the skillsets. 

I have deep experience in building custom hybrid apps as well. I have built multiple mobile apps that had seen over a million users scale. I built most of them as an individual contributor. 

As I mentioned, I have built most of the apps as an individual contributor, that experience helped me to develop and bring out my interest incomplete product development & management lifecycle, which helped me to take care of the product development in the companies that I am involved. I love playing the role of CPTO because it helps product development to be more agile and gives a quick turnaround.

After I started building products as an entrepreneur, We developed multiple Alexa Skills with a scale of 5 to 7 million interactions per month during the peek & one of the skill has around 400k users. Two of those skills were very popular (One is the high performing skill in India & another is popular in the bedtime stories category globally) and which helped us to be awarded as 'Alexa Star developer of the year 2019', 'Alexa Pioneers' & Won an international hackathon as well for a category.


Motivation is the key to be consistent. Here are some quotes that I like and love to share.

> First of all - start doing it, then do it right, then do it better is what I follow.

> While learning - much important is to get out *there* and *do*.

> Don't believe what others say is the right thing to do until you understand the reason behind it and convince yourself.

> Keep moving on is what I follow - I don't stay with the results (Either success or failure)

> In the knowledge hunt process - I love looking for improvement always and never allowed to settle myself with what I have at present.

> I love teaching others about what I learned - because I am more responsible while I am suggesting anything to someone else.
