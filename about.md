I am an android application developer and designer. 

What I beliefs,

> First do it, then do it right, then do it better is what i follows while taking up new roles.

> Nothing is innovated in the world as we had found everything available.

> While learning new things it is important to have a deep study, but much important is to get out there and *do*.


# SKILLS

  Through out my career, I have done various things related to mobile applications and web design. As a starting point, I developed a proffessional website for my college and that attitude continued in my career too as I do not want to say no to anyone who approaches for what I am capable of. 
      
  Later on I started getting dirty myself with Android as an Intern. Android Intern - Andriod applications developer - Senior Software Engineer - Lead developer - Mobile website designer - iOS application developer - Windows Phone application developer - Windows Mobile CE application developer - Backend Java application developer.
      
  Whole of this journey has included the following skills added to my plate.
